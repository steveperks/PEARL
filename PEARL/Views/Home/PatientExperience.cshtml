<hr />

<p style="font-size:1.5em;">
    The patient’s experience is increasingly recognised as a critical dimension of health care quality, and efforts to understand and improve that experience are longstanding within the NHS and many other health systems internationally
</p>

<hr />

<p style="font-size:1.5em;">
    The drive for greater involvement has collective and individual dimensions: fostering a stronger public voice in the development and improvement of local health services, alongside opportunities for patients to exercise choice and play a more active role in their own care. This agenda is not only about creating more accessible and responsive health services that are accountable to local communities. As Derek Wanless emphasised in his 2002 review of NHS funding, the long-term financial sustainability of the health service will crucially depend on the population being “fully engaged” in its health and health care.
